This test script is intended to give a block-level based overview of
SSD performance (SATA, SAS, and NVME) under real-world conditions by
focusing on sustained performance at different block sizes and queue
depths.  Both text-mode Linux and GUI and text-mode Windows versions
are included.

The results of multiple tests are summarized into a single OpenDoc format
spreadsheet, readable under OpenOffice, LibreOffice, or Microsoft Excel.

FIO is required to perform the actual IO tests.  Please ensure the latest
version is installed, either from your operating system's repository or
sources available at https://github.com/axboe/fio or precompiled for
Windows at https://ci.appveyor.com/project/axboe/fio (for the GIT latest)
or from https://www.bluestop.org/fio/ .

(There seems to be an issue with FIO 3.1 under Windows that is not present
under earlier or later builds.  In a nutshell, the 1200 second sustained
performance test ends up running, under this version, for over 12 hours!
While the final results are still good and the script continues, it does
waste a large amount of time and so I recommend avoiding the BlueStop 3.1
build.  The CI.appveyor.com link above can be used to get current FIO
head builds instead.)

ezFIO got where it is today through the help of many users who filed
bugs when things didn't work, or submitted patches to support new CPUs.
Please feel free to open issues or drop me a line if you have questions.

Special thanks to @coolrecep (Recep Balta≈ü) who has spent literally days
tracking down Windows issues.
